Site is currently under development.

<!-- This site contains an interactive [report](report.md) with the aim of forecasting the economic impact of sea level rise on Miami. The [model](model/note.md) produced is included as an embedded app which allows you to adjust parameters and see how this effects the outcome. This analysis was completed as a dependency for a larger project, more information on which can be found on the [conference](conference.md) page.

For the purpose of reproducibility, the [code](https://github.com/sunkcosts) used for the analysis is open source. You can submit a GitHub issue in the relevant repository if you find any inaccuracies and we'll attempt to address them time permitting.
