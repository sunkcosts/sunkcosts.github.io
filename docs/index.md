<h1 style="color: red;">Work in progress...</h1>

This site contains an interactive [report](report.md) aiming to forecast the economic impact of sea level rise in Miami. The [model](model/note.md) created is also available as an app which allows you to adjust the parameters, and see how this changes the outcome. This analysis was completed as a dependency for a larger project, more information on which can be found on the [conference](conference.md) page.

For the purpose of reproducibility, the [code](https://github.com/sunkcosts) used for the analysis is open source. You can submit a GitHub issue in the relevant repository if you find any inaccuracies. Time permitting, they will be addressed. Feel free to reach out directly via the [contact](contact.md) form.
