# Resource: Conference

## Context

The focus of this report is the economic forecast, however the analysis was performed to contrast the cost of losing Miami to sea level rise with the cost of deploying a space based sunshade for geoengineering purposes. The project proposal was presented at the [New Worlds](https://www.eventcreate.com/e/new-worlds#:~:text=Discussion%20%2D%20Project%3A%20EarthShade,safely%3F%20Let%27s%20discuss.) space conference. A modified [slide deck](../assets/documents/EarthShade-V2.pdf) for the proposal is included on this site.

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank the New Worlds Institute, and specifically Rick Tumlinson for getting us a presentation spot at the conference. We'd also like to thank Damian Clogher for assisting with presentation formatting and sunshade research.
