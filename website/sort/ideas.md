# Climate model
- NOAA tide and rain gauge records, and other datasets
- Create dataset of global, and miami specific sea level rise, along with dates

# Economic Model
- note that estimates from miami may be biased due to perverse economic incentives
	- show cost estimates by year
		- produced by miami/florida related entities, and external entities
- loss in economic output: eg - tourism
	- what industries will be affected and how?
	- what industries can move? (obv. tourism can't)
- factor probability and cost together, create 2D visualization of estimated cost distribution per year
	- create 3D visualization with 3rd axis as time
	- fit normal distribution model (or other dist if appl.) to model distribution of probabilities and costs
	- the estimated cost should be the mean of the probability distribution multiplied by the mean of the cost distribution (or the mean of the cost x probability dist.)
- factor in rising temperatures, property value declines or health impacts.
- model current real estate investment
	- currently increasing? this means more will be lost in the future - factor into model
- I should look into insurance claim datasets in the area
	- can ask: "Miami-Dade County's Public Works and Waste Management office" for datasets
- Should look into
	- zoning datasets
	- property value estimates
	- total economic output of Miami
	- cost of rehousing people
	- cost of attempting to build/maintain quick fix solutions
		- eg: pumping systems and walls
- Create dataset of miami specific economic cost estimates, along with dates, and the factors used for cost estimate (eg: property, externalities, GDP, etc)
- for meta analysis, include estimate (cost, SLR), year, and the type of source (article, publication, published in journal, government review)


- add leaflet map visualization to app?



- add to SLR map visualizations:
	- year
	- sea level rise height
- remove contact information for luke from miamilost project github pages site

slides
- slide to cover an estimate of the best/worst case scenarios
	- embed the video in the slide
- cost estimate
	- preliminary cost estimate is meta analysis of qualitative literature
- cost model doesn't include
	- pumps
	- hurricanes
