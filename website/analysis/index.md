# Analysis

## Abstract

## Context

The focus of this report is the economic forecast, however the analysis was performed to contrast the cost of losing Miami to sea level rise with the cost of deploying a space based sunshade for geoengineering purposes. The project proposal was presented in 2022 at the New Worlds space conference in Austin. A modified [slide deck](../file/document.slides.earthshade.pdf) for the proposal is included on this site.
