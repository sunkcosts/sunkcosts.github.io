!!! abstract "Report Abstract"
    TODO: Report abstract

!!! warning "Continuous Development"
    This analytical report and model are subject to change. If you find an issue with the methodology or have a suggestion for an improvement, please submit it in the [GitHub repository]() - either in the [issues]() or [discussions]() sections depending the type of feedback you are submitting.

!!! bug "Deployed Model Issues"
    If the model deployed on the [streamlit share](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app) instance is overloaded, you can also run it in a local python environment. See the [[model_quickstart|model quickstart]] page for more info.

??? note "Sunshade Project Context"
    The focus of this report is the economic forecast, however the analysis was performed to contrast the cost of losing Miami to sea level rise with the cost of deploying a space based sunshade for geoengineering purposes. The project proposal was presented in 2022 at the New Worlds space conference in Austin. A modified [slide deck](../file/internal/document.slides.earthshade.pdf) for the proposal is included on this site.
