# Economic Value Subjectivity

This page provides examples meant to illustrate the subjective and complex nature of economic assessments of value, in addition to the example provided on the [[forecast_caveats|Forecast Caveats]] page.

## Tangible vs. Intangible Assets

When we speak of the economic impacts of sea level rise, we often first consider tangible assets â€“ properties, infrastructure, and physical goods that can be directly measured in monetary terms. But how do we categorize and put a value on intangible assets impacted by SLR?

> A renowned artist has painted a mural on a building's exterior wall in a coastal district of Miami. This mural becomes a significant cultural and tourist attraction. Over the years, its intangible value in terms of cultural identity and tourism appeal grows exponentially. Now, due to SLR, there's a real threat of the building being submerged or destroyed. How do we quantify the loss of this mural?

If we look at it in terms of the artist's fee and the material costs, the monetary value might be relatively low. However, when factoring in its cultural significance, the lost potential tourism revenue, and its irreplaceability, the value becomes more nebulous.

## Collective vs. Individual Loss

Economic impacts can be felt at both individual and collective levels. For instance:

> A family-owned restaurant that has been operating for decades at Miami's seafront might face bankruptcy due to SLR causing frequent flooding in the area. On a macro level, the economic loss from this single restaurant might seem insignificant when talking about the entire city's economy. But for the family running it, it's their livelihood, heritage, and perhaps a significant part of their identity.

Is it justifiable to weigh the city's overall economic health over the devastating loss of a single family's livelihood? It's subjective and varies based on who you ask.

## Direct vs. Indirect Monetary Loss

While direct losses like property damage due to SLR are (relatively) straightforward to quantify, indirect losses can be nebulous.

> Due to constant threats of flooding, insurance premiums for properties in Miami might skyrocket. This can lead to reduced property values and, subsequently, reduced property tax revenues for the city. The cascading effect might also mean businesses relocating, leading to job losses and reduced economic activity in affected areas.

While we can quantify the immediate losses due to property damage, how do we adequately measure the long-term economic ripple effects of such events?
