# Forecast Caveats

In general when we encounter dilemmas like those listed below, we will address them as follows.

1. Point them out and note the biases and limitations of any given definition or approach, so that they may be refined via feedback and iteration.
2. Add the values as adjustable parameters to the model.

## Future Prediction

Predicting the future is impossible (or at least beyond our capabilities). We attempt to account for this by creating a model capable of generating a range of scenarios based on the inputs provided by the user, instead of a single discrete prediction. This is also helpful as creating a formal model lays bare assumptions and premises that may otherwise be overlooked, and allows bad assumptions or premises to be more easily caught by others.

??? note "Prediction Certainty"
    In this report, however, we do also attempt to provide estimates of 'best', 'medium', and 'worst' scenarios, as we assess it may increase general appeal.

## Inherent Subjectivity

Even if we could predict the future perfectly, the subjective nature of our reality confounds our ability to arrive at discrete monetary values. To concretize this rather abstract statement, we might ask: what is the value of a human life? Consider the following scenario:

> A father wakes up one morning to the sound a broadcast from the EAS telling him that a flash flood has unexpectedly inundated the area. He rushes downstairs and finds that the lower part of his house is already submerged. In a panic, he recalls that his teenage son had spent the night on the couch in the basement, playing video games on their new xbox.

If we asked this man the monetary value of his sons life, what would he say? We might reasonably expect that no discrete figure would suffice, as he values his son to such an extent that it cannot even be expressed in monetary terms.

Unfortunately, assigning an infinite value to each person would inhibit our ability to estimate the economic cost. Accordingly, we're going with the $7.5M figure provided by the  [[analysis/references#FEMA Benefit Cost Analysis Toolkit|FEMA BCA Toolkit]]. Note that while it is used as statistical estimate for the value of a human life, one can adjust the exact value up and down in the model.

??? tangent "Infinite Value Paradox"
    If we assign an infinite value to the life of each person, it follows that one person (with a value of infinity) is worth the exact same as any number of $X$ people, who together are all still worth an infinite amount. If one based one's decisions off this paradigm, one would be too paralyzed to get anything done or make sensible decisions, and the world may be worse of for it.
