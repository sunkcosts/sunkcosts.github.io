Original the mkdocs-bibtex extension was used, however this attempts to parse jupyter notebooks (I think). This would be fine except the embedded visualizations increase documentation build time many orders of magnitude.

## Research Paper

## Dataset

### Jason Satellite Data

The [Jason](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jason_satellite_series) satellites are a series of altimeter satellite missions deployed and operated by [NASA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/NASA) and [CNES](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CNES). The dataset we are using here is derived from Jason satellite data. Specifically, this dataset was produced by the [Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/lsa/index.php) at the [NOAA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration) using data from the Jason and TOPEX/Poseidon missions.
