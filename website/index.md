## Forecasting the Economic Impact of Sea Level Rise on Miami

</div>

!!! note "This site is under development. Please check back later."

<!--

!!! goal "Project Objectives"

    1. Create a model capable of forecasting the economic impact (or lack thereof) of sea level rise (SLR) on the city of Miami.
    2. Use it to produce informed estimates for 'best', 'medium', and 'worst' case impact scenarios by the year 2100.
    3. Create a high level companion analysis that provides a quantitative but approachable introduction to the topic.


    ??? details "[[analysis/index|Read the Analysis]]"
        This section has the analytical report, and is a good place to start. This section also includes:

        - A references page.
        - A section for secondary details that are linked inline (see: the potential issues admonition above).
        - A section for jupyter notebooks that are rendered on site.

    ??? details "[[documentation/index|Read the Documentation]]"
        This section has information on reproducing and working with the model and helper utilities.

    ??? details "[[forecast_caveats|Forecast Caveats]]"
        Potential issues with these goals and our mitigation approach can be found on this page.

    !!! tip "You can press `Command + K` or `Control + K` to open and close the quick search bar."

    }
    ```


??? question "Model Access & Bandwidth"
    There are two ways to access the model:

    1. You can access the model by going to the [webapp](https://sunkcosts.streamlit.app) deployed on streamlits free share service. There's a potential for exceeding the 1GB memory bandwidth provided by streamlit, and if that occurs, this won't work.
    2. You can run the GUI on your local machine. See the [[documentation/index|documentation]] for more information on this.

??? tangent "Sunshade Project Context"
    The focus of this report is the economic forecast, however the analysis was performed to contrast the cost of losing Miami to sea level rise with the cost of deploying a space based sunshade for geoengineering purposes. The project proposal was presented in 2022 at the New Worlds space conference in Austin. A modified [[document.slides.earthshade.pdf]] for the proposal is included on this site.

??? failure "Issues & Continuous Development"
    This analysis and model are subject to change. If you find an issue with the methodology or have a suggestion for an improvement, please submit it in the [GitHub repository]() - either in the [issues]() or [discussions]() sections depending the type of feedback you are submitting.
