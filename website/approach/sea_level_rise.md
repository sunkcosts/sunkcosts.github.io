# Sea Level Rise

We'll begin by taking an agnostic position on sea level rise (SLR), avoiding for now questions as to whether it is good or bad.

Instead, we will focus simply on answering whether it is happening, and if it is, to what extent (and in the context of the model forecast: to what extent we can be certain).

*rephrase


*have to note
- global SLR trends to not reflect miami specific SLR trends, there needs to be a modifier parameter specific to the miami model which can be tuned to account for this

*later
- we can use existing dataset to gen model, stratify different levels by year/probability
